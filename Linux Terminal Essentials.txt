Linux Terminal Essentials:


1. Check in which folder you are working in Terminal
Full Form: Present Working Directory
Command:
	pwd
Output:
	/home/user_name/Desktop


2. Create folder in Terminal
Full Form: Make Directory
Command:
	mkdir folder_name
Example:
	mkdir myFolder


3. Move to other working path in Terminal
Full Form: Change Directory
Command:
	cd folder_name
Example:
	cd myFolder


4. Move 1 folder back in Terminal
Eg.
     Desktop
         |
          -- myFolder

Your current working directory in Terminal is myFolder
eg. pwd -> output -> /home/user_name/Desktop/myFolder

Now you want to go Desktop (1 step previous)
Command:
	cd ..

Now your pwd will show output: /home/user_name/Desktop

Assignment (Try below commands):	
	cd ..
	pwd


5. Create any .file using NANO command
What nano does:
	1. create file if does not exists
	2. opens file in edit mode if it exists

Syntax:
	nano file_name.entension
E.g:
	nano index.html
	nano test.txt
	nano main.java

NOTE: Follow below steps to create test.txt file
Command:
	1. nano test.txt
	//write anything inside file

	2. press-> ctrl+o (to save)

	3. press-> ctrl+x (to exit)

Exercise: create index.html using nano and just add hello world in that file



6. Delete any File using Terminal
Note: this command is only used to delete any file.
      You cannot use this to delete folder

Full Form: remove
Syntax:
	rm file_name

NOTE: if you get error: not enough permission/unauthorized then use

	sudo rm file_name

NOTE: Make sure in industry be careful while using sudo  command

Example:
	rm test.txt


7. List files +(subfolders) present in current folder
Command:
	ls

Example:
	myFolder
           |
            -- index.html
            -- style.css

NOTE: Suppose you are in myFolder and you want to check how many files are present in it (it will also show subfolders)

Exercise:
	// check if you are in myFolder dir
	1. pwd

	2. ls
	// you will see output as index.html and style.css
	


8. Check (.all_extension) file using Terminal
Command:
	ls -a

Output:
	.bash_history
	.profile

	etc

NOTE: ls vs ls -a

	1. ls will only display folders and file created

	2. ls -a will show everything including .extensions file


Example:
	Command:
		1. cd ~

		2. ls
		// output: Documents Downloads Desktop etc..

		3. ls -a
		// output: same as ls output + (.bash_history .cache .profile)

		// All extension files are seen
		

9. Delete a folder (which maybe empty or non-empty folder)
Syntax: rm -r folder_name
Understanding:
	rm -> remove
	-r -> recursive (recursively)
	
// It means delete the folder and everything inside it
// (Complete Folder Deletion)

Example:
	1. rm -r myFolder

		or

	1. sudo rm -r myFolder



10. Clear the Terminal
Command:
	clear
